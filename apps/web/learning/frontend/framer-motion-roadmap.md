# Framer Motion Mastery Roadmap

A comprehensive, step-by-step checklist for learning Framer Motion professionally in React/Next.js projects. Check off each topic as you master it!

---

## 1. Introduction & Setup

- [x] What is Framer Motion? Use cases, advantages
- [x] Installation in React/Next.js
- [x] Importing and using `motion` components

## 2. Core Animation Concepts

- [x] `motion.div` and other primitives
- [x] `animate`, `initial`, `exit`, `transition` props
- [X] Easing, duration, delay, repeat
- [X] Keyframes

## 3. Gestures & Interactivity

- [X] `whileHover`, `whileTap`, `whileFocus`, `whileDrag`
- [X] Drag and drag constraints
- [X] Tap/hover/focus/press animations

## 4. Variants & Animation Orchestration

- [ ] What are Variants?
- [ ] Defining and using variants
- [ ] Parent-child orchestration (stagger, delayChildren)
- [ ] Dynamic variants (custom props)

## 5. AnimatePresence & Conditional Rendering

- [ ] What is AnimatePresence?
- [ ] Animating components on mount/unmount
- [ ] Exit animations
- [ ] Mode: 'wait', 'sync', 'popLayout'

## 6. Layout Animations

- [ ] Layout prop and automatic layout transitions
- [ ] Shared layout animations
- [ ] LayoutId for crossfade

## 7. Advanced Motion

- [ ] useAnimation controls
- [ ] useMotionValue, useTransform
- [ ] Scroll-based animations (useScroll, useInView)
- [ ] Custom hooks for animation logic
- [ ] SVG and path animations
- [ ] Gesture/animation accessibility

## 8. Performance & Best Practices

- [ ] Reducing re-renders
- [ ] Optimizing for mobile
- [ ] Combining with CSS/other animation libs
- [ ] Debugging motion

## 9. Real-World Patterns & Recipes

- [ ] Animated modals/dialogs
- [ ] Page transitions
- [ ] Lists and staggered items
- [ ] Drag-to-reorder
- [ ] Micro-interactions (buttons, icons)
- [ ] Animated navigation/menus

## 10. Resources & Further Learning

- [ ] Official docs deep dive
- [ ] Community examples
- [ ] Open source projects using Framer Motion
