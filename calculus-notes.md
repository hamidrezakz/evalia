1. The derivative of a function measures the rate of change of its output with respect to the independent variable, and is defined as the slope of the tangent line at a point, calculated by taking the limit of the ratio of increments; a function must be continuous to be differentiable.

## Types of Functions

## Types of Functions

A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set D exactly one element, called fsxd, in a set E.

1. **Polynomial Function**

   - A function that is the sum of powers of the variable with constant coefficients, e.g. $f(x) = 2x^3 - x + 5$

2. **Exponential Function**

   - A function where the variable is in the exponent, e.g. $f(x) = e^x$ or $f(x) = 2^x$

3. **Trigonometric Function**

   - Functions based on angles, such as $f(x) = \sin x$, $\cos x$, $\tan x$

4. **Logarithmic Function**

   - A function involving the logarithm, e.g. $f(x) = \ln x$ or $f(x) = \log_{10} x$

5. **Rational Function**

   - A function that is the ratio of two polynomials, e.g. $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 3}$

6. **Piecewise Function**

   - A function defined by different expressions in different intervals, e.g. $f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 & x < 0 \\ x+1 & x \geq 0 \end{cases}$

7. **Absolute Value Function**
   - A function that returns the non-negative value of its input, e.g. $f(x) = |x|$

  ## Derivative and Related Terms

### Derivative

**derivative, differentiation, differentiate, rate of change, slope, tangent, instantaneous rate, gradient**

- Definition: The derivative of a function measures how its output changes as the input changes. It is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at a point.

### Differentiation

**differentiation, differentiate, process of finding a derivative**

- Definition: The act of finding the derivative of a function.
- Example: "Differentiate $f(x) = x^2$ to get $f'(x) = 2x$."

### Rate of Change

**rate of change, velocity, speed, growth rate**

- Definition: How quickly a quantity changes with respect to another.
- Example: "The rate of change of position is velocity."
- Usage: "The derivative measures the rate of change."

### Slope

**slope, gradient, steepness**

- Definition: The measure of how steep a line is; in calculus, the slope of the tangent line at a point.
- Example: "The slope of $y = x^2$ at $x = 1$ is $2$."
- Usage: "The derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent."

### Tangent

**tangent, tangent line**

- Definition: A straight line that touches a curve at a single point without crossing it.
- Example: "The tangent to the curve at $x = a$."
- Usage: "Draw the tangent line at $x = 2$."

### Instantaneous Rate

**instantaneous rate, instantaneous velocity**

- Definition: The rate of change at a specific instant.

**limit**

- Definition: The value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value; used to define the derivative.
- Example: $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$
- Usage: "The derivative is defined using a limit."

### Continuous / Differentiable

**continuous, differentiable**

- Definition: A function is continuous if it has no breaks; it is differentiable if it has a derivative at every point.
- Example: "Every differentiable function is continuous."
- Usage: "Check if the function is differentiable."
