# Linux & Docker Learning Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for a full-stack developer aiming to deploy Node.js/NestJS/Next.js projects on Linux servers using Docker. You can check off each step as you progress. The structure is clear for both human and AI assistants to track your learning and goals.

## Personal Learning Goals

- Full-stack JavaScript developer (Node.js, NestJS, Next.js, React, etc.)
- Become a professional in Linux and server management (not just basic deployment)
- Fast-track learning and focus on essentials to deliver current project quickly
- Learning is focused on site and application management (deployment, scaling, security, monitoring)

> Note: This roadmap is optimized for rapid progress due to urgent project delivery, but the long-term goal is deep expertise in Linux and server administration.

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Step 1: Install Linux on your Windows laptop (Dual Boot or Virtual Machine)
- [x] Step 2: Learn basic Linux terminal commands
- [x] Step 3: File and directory management in Linux
- [x] Step 4: Install and manage software with apt
- [x] Step 5: User management, permissions, and sudo
- [ ] Step 6: Install Docker on Linux
- [ ] Step 7: Run your first Docker container
- [ ] Step 8: Write a Dockerfile for a Node.js/NestJS project
- [ ] Step 9: Learn docker-compose and run multiple services
- [ ] Step 10: Prepare your project for deployment (env, build, etc.)
- [ ] Step 11: (Optional) Learn basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Step 12: (Optional) Buy a VPS and deploy your project

## Details for Each Step

### Step 1: Install Linux on Windows

- Choose between Dual Boot (Ubuntu + Windows) or Virtual Machine (VirtualBox/VMware).
- Recommended: Use VirtualBox and install Ubuntu for easy switching.
- Resources:
  - [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  - [Ubuntu ISO](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
  - [How to Install Ubuntu on VirtualBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4K8JkK2EwU)

### Step 2: Learn Basic Linux Terminal Commands

- cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, rm, mv, cp, nano, cat, sudo
- Practice navigating and manipulating files/folders.

### Step 3: File and Directory Management

- Create, delete, move, and copy files and directories.
- Understand hidden files and permissions.

### Step 4: Install and Manage Software

- Use apt to install, update, and remove packages.
- Example: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`

### Step 5: User Management & Permissions

- Add/remove users, change passwords, use sudo.
- Set file permissions with chmod and chown.

### Step 6: Install Docker

- Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu.
- Resources:
  - [Official Docker Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

### Step 7: Run Your First Docker Container

- Pull and run a simple image (e.g., hello-world, nginx).
- Learn basic docker commands: docker run, docker ps, docker stop, docker rm

### Step 8: Write a Dockerfile for Node.js/NestJS

- Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js app.
- Build and run your app in a container.

### Step 9: Learn docker-compose

- Write a docker-compose.yml to run multiple services (app + database).

### Step 10: Prepare Project for Deployment

- Set up environment variables, production builds, and secrets.

### Step 11: (Optional) Learn CI/CD

- Automate build and deploy with GitHub Actions.

### Step 12: (Optional) Buy VPS & Deploy

- Choose a VPS provider, set up server, deploy containers.
